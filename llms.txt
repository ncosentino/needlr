# Needlr

> Opinionated fluent dependency injection for .NET with source generation.

Needlr automates service registration, decorator wiring, hosted service
discovery, keyed services, factories, interceptors, and AI agent integrations
(Semantic Kernel, Microsoft Agent Framework) with compile-time safety.

- [Home](https://github.devleader.ca/needlr/) -- Needlr is an opinionated fluent dependency injection library for .NET with source generation -- automate service registration, decorators, interceptors, factories, and AI integrations with compile-time safety.
- [Getting Started](https://github.devleader.ca/needlr/getting-started/) -- Learn how to install and set up Needlr for dependency injection in .NET -- step-by-step guide covering NuGet packages, source generation, reflection, and your first console and web application.
- [Core Concepts](https://github.devleader.ca/needlr/core-concepts/) -- Understand Needlr's architecture -- the Syringe class, source generation vs reflection discovery strategies, service lifetimes, and automatic registration rules for .NET dependency injection.

## Features

- [Service Registration](https://github.devleader.ca/needlr/register-as/) -- Use the RegisterAs attribute to control exactly which interfaces a class is registered as in .NET dependency injection, overriding Needlr's default all-interface registration.
- [Hosted Services](https://github.devleader.ca/needlr/hosted-services/) -- Automatically discover and register IHostedService and BackgroundService implementations in .NET using Needlr -- no attributes required for hosted service auto-discovery.
- [Keyed Services](https://github.devleader.ca/needlr/keyed-services/) -- Register and resolve multiple implementations of the same interface in .NET 8+ using Needlr's Keyed attribute -- keyed service support with source generation and reflection.
- [Options Binding](https://github.devleader.ca/needlr/options/) -- Opinionated fluent dependency injection for .NET with source generation
- [Factories](https://github.devleader.ca/needlr/factories/) -- Generate factory interfaces and delegates for .NET classes that require runtime constructor parameters using Needlr's GenerateFactory attribute -- source generation only.
- [Providers](https://github.devleader.ca/needlr/providers/) -- Opinionated fluent dependency injection for .NET with source generation
- [Interceptors](https://github.devleader.ca/needlr/interceptors/) -- Add cross-cutting concerns to .NET services using Needlr interceptors -- intercept method calls with a single implementation that works across any service without modifying business logic.
- [Open Generic Decorators](https://github.devleader.ca/needlr/open-generic-decorators/) -- Define a single decorator class that automatically wraps all closed implementations of an open generic interface in .NET using Needlr's open generic decorator support -- source generation only.
- [Service Catalog](https://github.devleader.ca/needlr/service-catalog/) -- Opinionated fluent dependency injection for .NET with source generation
- [Breadcrumbs](https://github.devleader.ca/needlr/breadcrumbs/) -- Opinionated fluent dependency injection for .NET with source generation
- [AI Integrations](https://github.devleader.ca/needlr/ai-integrations/) -- Integrate AI agent frameworks with Needlr in .NET -- automatic function discovery, DI wiring, and lifecycle management for Semantic Kernel and Microsoft Agent Framework.

## Advanced

- [Advanced Usage](https://github.devleader.ca/needlr/advanced-usage/) -- Advanced patterns for Needlr -- custom assembly scanning, conditional registration, multi-project setups, and edge cases for complex .NET dependency injection scenarios.
- [Plugin Development](https://github.devleader.ca/needlr/plugin-development/) -- Build modular .NET applications with Needlr plugins -- implement IServiceCollectionPlugin and IWebApplicationPlugin to encapsulate service registration and configuration in reusable units.
- [Benchmarks](https://github.devleader.ca/needlr/benchmarks/) -- Opinionated fluent dependency injection for .NET with source generation
